                <p>Web Developers have a variety of things to do. Their main job is to create websites by writing computer programs using code, and updating them. Here are some of the main tasks in an order that web developers do:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>They first plan how the website will look and work</li>
                    <li>They write computer programs in code based on the plan</li>
                    <li>Designers may have to design images for the site</li>
                    <li>They then test the website to make sure they work according to plan</li>
                    <li>Often, the websites may have display issues or may not function properly. In these cases, the developers fix these problems (called “bugs”). This is called “debugging”.</li>
                    <li>A web developer’s work doesn’t end after just creating the website. They have to deploy it, meaning they have to make the websites accessible to the public.</li>
                    <li>They have to update the site’s content and may even improve functionality after the website is deployed. To make sure the website is properly updated, they use version control systems such as git.</li>
                </ul>
