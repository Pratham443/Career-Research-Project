            <h1>Overview</h3>
            <p>A web developer is a person who creates and updates websites as a profession. Web Development is a special and important job, which is quite different from others. Web Developers are having an increasing impact on the world. Without websites, our life would be different from the ones we have today. Web Developers have different working conditions, as they principally work from their homes and have less work hours than other careers. Their income is comparable to other major jobs and further growth in demand for developers is expected. Nowadays, many universities provide computer science and related majors which are beneficial to a web developer. But as a web developer, educational requirements arenâ€™t as strict as some other jobs. But proficiency in programming languages such as HTML and CSS is required. Web Developers can also work as freelancers, which means they work for clients individually. Freelancing is quite risky, with them sometimes hitting lows, or getting skyrocketing high amounts of money. Despite all of these good factors, web development can be stressful, and spending a lot of time on computers can cause pain in the neck or other areas. Web developers have to take care of their health a little more than other people.</p>
